* Dumbphones  
  Today, Iâ€™d like to talk about [[https://reddit.com/r/dumbphones][dumbphones]].  
  Theyâ€™re truly an amazing thingâ€”you donâ€™t even realize how great it feels to be mentally shielded from doomscrolling, anxiety, and so on.  

  Before this, like most people, I spent way too much time on my smartphone:  
  watching YouTube videos, Twitch streams, and scrolling through social media.  
  (Though, to be fair, I still donâ€™t see much harm in it if done mindfully.)  

  I didnâ€™t discover dumbphones on my own. After watching a video by [[https://youtube.com/@jvscholz][jvscholz]] on YouTube (I wonâ€™t link it here), I decided to give them a try. \\ 
  At first, I tried "dumbing down" my Android:  
  - Installed *OLauncher*  
  - Limited screen time using *Digital Wellbeing* (an Android feature)  

  But even then, I still found myself occasionally glued to my phone. Thatâ€™s when I started considering getting a feature phone with buttons.  

** Qin F22 Pro  
   While browsing [[https://reddit.com/@jvscholz][r/@jvscholz]] on Reddit (Iâ€™ll come back to digital minimalism later), I learned that people still use feature phones at all.  
   After seeing Jamesâ€™ top picks for button phones, I ordered myself an *F22 Pro* ðŸ™‚.  

   Well, after setting it up, my first impressions were:  
   #+begin_quote  
   Life feels so much simplerâ€”less anxiety, more freedom.  
   #+end_quote    

   Iâ€™ve been using this phone for two months now. I traveled with it, paid for groceries via QR codes, and even took family photos on it ðŸ˜….  

   Honestly, Iâ€™m really happy with this phone. It meets all my needs from a modern device, and I continue to use it mindfully.  

*** Setup  
    In this section, Iâ€™ll share how I configured this phone and what apps I installed.  
    1. Install *Niagara Pro*  \\
       Seriously, the best launcher for feature phones.  
    2. Install [[https://github.com/austinauyeung/C9][C9]]   \\
       The best app for cursor navigation using arrow keys.  
    3. Set up *Button Key Mapper*  \\
       I donâ€™t remember the exact app name or settings, but itâ€™s essential.  

       I might add more details in the comments later.  

* Digital Minimalism  
  You know, even after switching to a dumb (well, technically *transient*) phone, I still caught myself doomscrolling on my computerâ€”sometimes even during important work.  

  At first, I didnâ€™t pay much attention to it. Iâ€™d tell myself,  
  "Just a few more minutes on this site, then Iâ€™ll start working."  
  I also fell into the trap of "this is for learning" sites (Reddit, YouTube).  

  What saved me was a tool (an alternative to Cold Turkey) called [[https://www.digitalzen.app/][DigitalZen]].  
  (Not sponsored, but I wouldnâ€™t mindâ€”I should leave a review on their site.)  
  I highly recommend trying it if you havenâ€™t already.  

** My Experience with DigitalZen  
   Okay, I installed the extensionâ€”now what?  
   Next, you customize it to fit your needs (which is super easy).  

   My current setup:  
   - A block from *6:00 AM to 1:00 PM* for studying  
     (I canâ€™t access any sites except study-related ones)  
   - Focus time for coding  \\
     A timer during which I canâ€™t visit distracting sites  
     (Only coding resources: GitHub, docs.rs, etc.)  

   This workflow helps me stay productive and maintain focus.  
   (Also, distractions are a fascinating topic on their own.)  

   Thank you, DigitalZen! ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³
